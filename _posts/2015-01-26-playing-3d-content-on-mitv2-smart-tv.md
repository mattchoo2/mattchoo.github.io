I actually found watching 3D movies very nice to watch after owning my own 3D TV.  

I would like to share my experience on setting up 3D viewing on MiTV2.  

  

Sources of Â 3D videos:  

  

1. 3D TV channels
2. Computer
3. Blu-ray
4. Streaming Apps e.g. ICNTV, Plex

  


  

How to switch to 3D mode on TV?

1. **HDMI Sources** e.g. 3D TV channels, Computer & Blu-ray

* Using **Menu button** on remote control - for content sourced via HDMI

3. **Streaming Apps**

* 3D content in **ICNTV** (MiTV default VOD library) - **Automatic**
* Other streaming apps **excluding ICNTV**



* **Neither Automatic nor able to change via Menu Button on remote control**
* **Solution: Touch Panel below MiTV**
