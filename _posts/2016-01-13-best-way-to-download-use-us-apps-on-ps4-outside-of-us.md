**Context**  

I am not staying in US, how to get all these US app & get it working?  

  

**Summary**  

  

1. Create a new PS account (free) make sure country is US. (Do not create sub-account. A lots of complicated restriction)
2. Use the US PS account to download all the apps
3. Switch back to your primary account which you have PS Plus subscription etc.
4. You can access all the US apps in the TV folders (without switching back to US PS account)

  

**Apps Worthy to Download**

1. Netflix
2. Hulu
3. Crunchyroll
4. Cracker
5. Plex

Note: Netflix & Hulu app interfaces are the best compared to their respective version in all platforms
