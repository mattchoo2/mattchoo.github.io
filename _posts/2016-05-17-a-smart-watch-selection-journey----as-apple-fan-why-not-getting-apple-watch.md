Quick Smart watch comparative reasons below:  

  

1. Classic Pebble - My favourite meet the purpose watch - reading notification is a breeze.

* What makes me turn it down?

+ I have 2 classic pebble watches. Both e-ink screen spoiled within 6 months duration. Random scratch line which renders the watch not usable.
+ The shift from pebble app to pebble time app sometime early 2016 really screwed up everything. Every time the app forces me to update and it always ended up a factory reset of the watch and phone setting.  Best part, pebble classic enjoy no new features.

3. Apple watch

* It came into my radar... then off away from my list.
* The watch OS has high requirement on iOS. Watch OS 2 requires iOS9 and above.  Must charge with Apple exclusive charger cost around RM175.
* I am on iPhone 6 Plus iOS 8.4. I am not going to upgrade -- in the past, Three iPhone i have upgraded, battery life & phone speed screwed up.
* And, its not compatible with Android.  It means if any case, your phone upgrade will have to be Apple iPhone. Else, your Apple watch will be more stupid and classic watch.
* Of all features highlighted, i still just want notifications.

5. Samsung Wear Gear 2

* Creating their Tizen OS  for watch which i think equivalent to Window phone OS -- bad app compatibility

7. Huawei watch

* Nice watch but metal band is RM2500 similar like apple watch.
* This reached my short list

9. Ticwatch (SELECTED)

* Considering i only want the notification on the go and nice watch faces, I have chosen Ticwatch 1st gen (without Apple MFI) = RM800+ include shipment to Malaysia.
* Winning points:

+ Below RM1,000 which fits the product nature -- a gadget that likely only have 1 year lifespan.
+ Come with metal band
+ Compatible with iOS & Android
+ Android 5 OS overlay with Ticwear OS 3.4 overlay
+ Can charge with ANY Qi wireless charger
