One problem connecting PS4 to a PC monitor is that most of these monitors (at least not the latest or expensive one) only have DVI & VGA port. Â It has put me through a numbers of hours what has went wrong? Why didn't the screen show - just blank?  


**What did I use?**

* I bought a HDMI-DVI converter as image attached & use it with a HDMI cable
* What i get? This adapter works with my mac mini but not PS4.
* On PS4, blank screen. After safe mode resolution reset to 480, see PS logo for 1 second then blank screen again.

  

**What are the hypothetical NOT True Reasons you may get to trying to troubleshoot?**  

  

1. Unchecked "Enable HDCP" in PS4 System setting
2. Is the adapter failing to response to a HDCP handshake?
3. Is my monitor HDCP compliance?
4. Go into safe mode to restore the PS4 to 480p resolution so all screen type fits
5. DVI got DVI-I & DVI-D - am i using the right adapter?

**What I learned from my experience - Conclusion?**

1. Buy a ONE-PIECE cable with both end Male HDMI-to-Male DVI (do not use a cable plus a converter)

2. It is not necessary to have an active adapter with power supply
3. An adapter piece which required more than one item to connect PS4 & PC monitor is likely treated as you trying to pirate copyright content e.g. from Netflix, Hulu etc
4. My Netflix/ Hulu works like normal

**DVI only carry video - what about audio?**

1. Just connect earpiece or speaker via the remote controller 3.5mm jack.
2. Bluetooth Speaker is not supported (Tested with Beakon speaker)
