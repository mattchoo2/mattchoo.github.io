<br>I find this quite true. Â I have been thinking about installing alarm when I renovated my house.  

Yet 5 years after renovation, I didn't realise car's alarm system can be as good until I read an article somewhere.  

  

The facts:  

  

* All cars have alarm system that can be triggered by car remote
* Car has MORE & BRIGHTER LIGHTS blinking that enable your neighbour to know you are in trouble (I normally couldn't identify which neighbour household has alarm triggered)

Thus, bring your car remote to bed with you.
A small effort may save you one day.
