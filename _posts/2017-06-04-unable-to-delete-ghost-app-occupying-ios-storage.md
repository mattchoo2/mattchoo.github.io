If you have similar problem like in the picture above "crisisactiontw" where you cannot delete it. I have the solution for you.
  

**What is it?**
It is not spam, it is not spyware.
It is app failed to install properly.
  

How to remove it?
Go google for name.
I have two of such apps "crisisactiontw" "col2en".
Once you identify the app, go to App Store in your phone, install or update it, then go back home screen, wait for installation complete, hold icon and delete it as usual. 
  

That's it<br>
