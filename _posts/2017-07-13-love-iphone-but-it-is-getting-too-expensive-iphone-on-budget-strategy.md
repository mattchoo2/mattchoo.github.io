I am an iPhone fan staying in Malaysia.  

My current iPhone is iPhone 6 Plus, it is marking at RM4k at the time I bought it.  

  

Now, what would you do if it is time to retire your old iPhone?  

Obviously you have few options:  

1. Switch to Android phone
2. Buy latest iPhone at regular retail price
3. Buy iPhone at the cheapest budget

  

Today, we are only talking about **option 3 - Buy iPhone at the cheapest budget.**
Quick answer is **iPhone 6 (4.7" screen)  with 32GB** internal storage capacity only - RM1,499.
  

  

You could have following concerns:

1. Is it a refurbished phone?
2. Isn't iPhone 6 two generations old now? and going to be three Gen old when iphone 8 launch this year.
3. 32GB, this is not sufficient for my photos and videos itself plus many apps I want to install.

My answers are as below:

1. It is new iPhone 6
2. The speed is still flawless at iOS 10.3.2 and I do not intend to upgrade to iOS 11.  
   It also has a bonus perk, earphone jack.
3. Case 1: If you have been using iPhone for many years and you do not mind the photo album is empty --> you are fine.  
   Case 2: you want all photos in new iPhone, the answer is **iCloud, it only cost RM3.90 per month for 50GB** & turn on **"optimize iPhone storage" in iCloud setting**

  

I do the setup for my wife as such with iCloud service enabled.  

The 32GB iPhone still have about 18GB free storage space after complete setup. She can still access all her photos from as far as year 2008.  

  

Note: How iCloud photo works?  
With icloud and optimize iphone storage on, all your photos and videos in your album are thumbnails.  It will download from internet every time you are accessing it.  

  

Yes, there is no Game app with 1GB installed. But, all other social media, navigation tools etc are all installed.  

  

Hope you find this helpful.
