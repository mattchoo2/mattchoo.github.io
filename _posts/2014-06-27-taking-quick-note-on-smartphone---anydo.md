A lots of time, I just need to make some quick note on phone.  

  

Any.DO is my most preferred choice to date after trying:  

  

* iOS note
* iOS reminder
* Evernote

Reasons for me:

1. I don't really need to categorize and save them properly
2. It is just Quick note that some time I don't even need to set a reminder
3. It can sync across iOS, Android & google chrome browsers

How:

1. Tap open App
2. Pull down to type new note
3. Done (if you don't need to set a reminder)
