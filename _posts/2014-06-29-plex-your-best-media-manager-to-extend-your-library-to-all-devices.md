Plex is just so cool!  

One line... The End...  

  

Nah... There are more.  

  

**Before Plex**, these are what I need to go through to manage my media across all my devices:  

  

1. Find the videos file and download it
2. Ensure the format is correct.  Else, need to convert it to the right format

* Note: Many of the formats do not work across platforms e.g. Mac, Window, iOS, Android
* Shall I keep Two format copies for all videos?

4. Rename, Sort, Keep it in the right order in my computer or storage
5. Whenever I wish to watch it other than the storage device, I need to:

* Connect my phone or tablet to computer via USB cable
* Load the selected movies into my phone or tablet
* Delete it after watch

Mmm... Not so fun
  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  

**Now with Plex**...

1. Find the videos file and download it

* Automatic Naming & Sorting
* Automatic Cover Art & Info download (description, actors etc)

3. Watch it on Any Device directly *(No format conversion ever required)*
4. Tap a button in app to sync (download) content to phone or tablet Wirelessly

* Videos watched are automatically marked as "watched"
* Note: Sync is a PAID feature



**Where?**

You can actually watch IN HOME & OUT OF HOME even you are FREE account:

1. FREE account

* In Home -- Stream over local WiFi network
* Out of Home -- Stream over WiFi or 3G network

3. PAID account

* In Home -- Stream over local WiFi network
* Out of Home

+ Stream over WiFi or 3G network

**What devices Plex support?** A LOTS..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  

Requirements:

1. A file servers to store all video files (recommend to have minimum 1TB)
2. A computer (Mac/ Window) to manage the video casting to your device

* This is recommended as the computer needs capacity to manage the video format and quality streaming from the server to your devices
* Other options are to use servers with built-in processor capacity

4. LAN cables to connect Server--Router--Computer for best streaming experience

  

How to Setup:
Basic

1. Register for Free on [Plex website](http://www.plexapp.com/)
2. Download "Plex Media Server" for your computer managing the media

* Login
* Select the folder where you store your videos

+ Recommend to store your Series and Movies in different folders

4. Download Apps for the devices you needs

* Login on Plex Media Server and Apps

6. Walaah... you are ready to go!!!

Advance

1. If you wish to sync (download) videos into your devices, you need to purchase a premium service (recommend one time fee of USD$75)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  

Areas of improvements:

1. Cloud Sync -- Redundant

* I find Cloud Sync to be cool but less practical as using Cloud Sync is similar to use streaming from home computer

3. Plex Media Server + Bit Torrent -- Crashed

* As the latest version enable instantaneous library update, it will crashed my computer whenever I have both bit torrent and Plex Media Server on at the same time
* I would recommend to at least have the option for Manual library update only


If you have any queries not covered above,  just comment below and I will response.
