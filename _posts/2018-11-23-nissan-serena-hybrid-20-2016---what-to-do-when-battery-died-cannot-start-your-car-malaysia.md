If you reading this because you are now facing this problem with your Nissan Serena Hybrid 2.0 (2016), following are the core steps:  

1. **Confirm if your car is MAIN battery problem, signs:**

* wireless key will not work, can only unlock door manually with key
* wiper, front light, dashboard & horn all will not work (no light at all)
* break peddle (middle) very hard at bottom

3. **Solution:**

* Jump Start
* Call your regular/ nearby Nissan center for battery replacement in advance (new battery need pre-charge an hour before install, accordingly)
* Important tip: As car is hybrid with 2 batteries, this is the main battery location (red circle)

5. **Jump start rule:**

* You have to borrow from someone.  Your second row & back doors are all locked by system, you cannot access back of your car.
* Portable jump start battery box will work
* Connect jump start cable black to black & red to red
* Within minute (1-2 minutes) > press horn > got sound > start engine > drive to change battery

7. **Myth about jump start:**

* Must be same model car (false)
* Must charge x minutes before can start (false)

9. **Other things I learned:**

* Ask technician come change battery may not be option as it need to remove some parts near the circle & a calibration with computer is required
* Tow service is not an option as steering wheel is locked by system.

+ if battery can be charged a bit and press push start button turn on dash board, steering wheel will be unlocked
+ Well, your car engine can be started like normal if you only have battery problem

* Buying Tan Chong Motor insurance (Nissan car importer in Malaysia) has no technical support advantage

  

=================================================

**Now my not so great experience with Nissan motor insurance care line - Malaysia**
=================================================
  

Note: At the end I do get few helpful staffs helped me settle my problem. A great thank you to them. What I am summarizing here is a service gap.
  

1. **22Nov2018 - Touched down in  KLIA2 discovered my car in Gateway@KLIA2 couldn't start.**

* Called 1-800-88-3838 Nissan emergency care line at 8.41pm @ 22 Nov 2018
* Duration of call is 7min 35seconds
* Has informed my car model & parked in multilevel carpark
* Also done trouble shooting check
* Agent gave me 3 options on the spot:

+ ask technician come to jump start
+ ask technician come change battery
+ ask tow truck to tow my car to a workshop i want

* I asked for option 1 & 2 - the great response after that is "sorry sir, there is no technician available at this hour & KLIA2 is very far"
* Meantime, I failed to jump start the car

+ I later realized the problem is I was connecting to the wrong battery (Day 2 story)
+ This totally can be avoided if the care line care a little bit more

* Back to the options, I also don't know how to manage option 3, my priority is to send my tired family with two elderly and a toddler of 3 years old back home after 5 days travel.
* I respect that so i took a Grab home first. Will try to settle this next day

3. **23Nov2018 - went back KLIA2 from bukit jalil area**

* 7.49am - called 1-800-88-3838 Nissan emergency care line to arrange tow truck so that tow truck and I can arrived same time. Request rejected as i need to be there first.

+ As a fact, it was the suggested approach by another agent from same care line to do so (called at 22Nov 8.57pm)

* Fine - I reached there and called care line again 9.48am

+ Another agent go through trouble shoot check again and arrange a tow truck
+ Checked to make sure hand break and gear can be shifted to neutral
+ On the conversation, she warned me cannot try jump start as it may damage my car & Nissan will not be responsible for any damage caused

* Best thing happen - tow truck arrived at 11.10am

+ **Car cannot be towed as steering wheel is locked by system**

* After tow truck driver and Gateway staffs helpful assistant --> they managed to jump start the car.  They managed to identify the right battery.  A great thank you to them
* I then drive my car to Nissan Cheras Selatan service center to get my battery changed

+ Also big thank you for them to get the battery ready in advance too.

5. **Take away:**

* Tan Chong motor insurance care line is not technical equipped OR at least take effort to connect technician/ provide voice guided technical support
* Nissan emergency care line is really waste of time.  They just want to close your request ticket and that's it.  Quote back:

+ Technician change battery --> not a viable option for Nissan Serena Hybrid
+ Tow car --> not viable as steering is locked by system
+ Only option --> jump start and drive yourself
