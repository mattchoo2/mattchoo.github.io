This is a problem that troubled me a long long time.  

Up to a month.  And this sound is so irritating that i played PS4 much lesser too.  

  

What I have tried:  

  

* Clear all the notifications (it works for one time)
* Go into sleep mode (at total shutdown -- hold power down for about 8 second and let go once 2nd beep is heard)

+ Rebuild database
+ Update system OS (oddly enough it can keep update the OS with the same OS you already installed)
+ Think i have only not tried to reset and delete all data i have (cos many games are downloaded via PlayStation Plus Free Games -- don't want to lose them)

  

  

Only after the a long search, one PS4 support forum's thread identify the real problem:  

The Screw for manual eject of disc drive is loose.  

I was so don't know what to say when I realise this is true.   Many of the PS4 folks even send it back for warranty.  

  

Thanks for the support forum [HERE](http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-4-Support/PS4-Beeping-and-Ejecting-Disc/td-p/43181382).  

  

Solution summary:  
### Step 1: Remove the glossy section of the cover

1. 1. Turn off the PS4.
   2. Unplug the power, HDMI, and any other cables from the back of your PS4 system.
   3. On a clean, flat, surface place the PS4 in front of you so the front of the system is on the left. (The PS logo on the top of the PS4 should be right side up.)
   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/1.jpg)5. Place you palms on the glossy panel and let your fingers rest on the far side of the console.
   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/2.jpg)7. Apply moderate, even pressure near the seam with your palms, and using your fingers as leverage, slide the glossy panel away from you.
   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/3.jpg)9. A click will be heard, and the panel will move about 1/4". Lift the panel off starting from the left side.

   ### Step 2: Locate the manual eject screw & Tighten the screw (rotate clockwise)
   
   1. With the glossy panel removed, you will see two sets of vents lining the outer left edge. Follow the slot from the front locate the first "single" slot (it's the slot not grouped with any other slots) in the vent.

   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/6.jpg)5. Slide the small screw driver into the vent slot and turn the screw clockwise  3-6 rotations of the screw. Very little effort is required to turn the screw. [ Follow the instruction as written -- Do not follow the picture as it is trying to eject the disc while we trying to achieve the reverse]
   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/7.jpg)Step 3: Put everything back together
   1. Replace the glossy panel. Place it over the exposed section of the PS4, about 1/4 of inch away from the seam. Then, slide the panel towards seam until it clicks into place.
   ![](https://support.us.playstation.com/euf/assets/KCimages/kbid_5061/9.jpg)3. Connect the HDMI, power, and any other cables that were disconnected in Step 1.
   4. Power on the PS4 to make sure everything is functioning properly.
   That's it, you are done!
